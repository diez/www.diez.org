## How to adopt Diez into multiple codebases

While we have guides for integrating your Diez project into existing projects ([iOS](/existing-project-integration/ios), [JavasScript](/existing-project-integration/JavasScript), [CSS/Sass](/existing-project-integration/css-sass)), we'll use this guide as an overview on how to use your Diez project across multiple codebases both in development and production .

If you're going to use your Diez project's compiled libraries (SDKs) across multiple codebases, **we recommend placing you Diez project in its own stand-alone GitHub repo.** Doing so will make it easier to develop, maintain, and version as its own entity.


### Publishing your Diez project's SDKs to package managers
After you've created and compiled your [Diez project](/getting-started/#set-up) and placed it in its own repo, you'll want navigate into its build folder (`cd build/your-package-web|ios|android`) and publish the compiled SDKs to your team's private package manager solution for each of your application targets. After your packages are published, you'll need to reference them from your application codebases (E.g. for web, list it in your `package.json`).

### Developing your design system and applications simultaneously
As you may have noticed, you've already solved your team's cross-platform, versioned design token needs! But what if you want to develop and experiment with your Diez project *while* you also develop on your applications that consume it?

Let's use JavaScript (web) as an example. From your Diez project, cd into the build folder and run:
```bash
yarn && yarn link
```

Then wander over to the root of your application codebase and run:
```bash
yarn link <your-package>
```

After following these steps, you'll be able to develop locally on both your Diez project and your application codebase while still maintaining a production version of your Diez project on GitHub (your token definitions) and NPM (the a compiled SDK/package).
